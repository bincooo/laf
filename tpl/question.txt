</plot>
The plot pauses here to emphasize the requirements you need to complete.

First review the contents inside “<requirement>”, “<card>”, “<example>” and “<plot>” xml tags above, and then focus on the requirements and **FORMAT** that you need to complete as a simulation system inside “<card>”.

The “<delete>” is what you must delete in your response.
<delete>
1. Out-of-plot contents.
2. Evaluation, subjective opinions and recommendations on the plot as Assistant.
</delete>

After you fully understand all of the above requirements, continue the above “<plot>” in the second person in Simplified Chinese.

Prohibit any XML tags from appearing in the output, e.g. `</plot>`.
You must write the answer as succinctly as possible.
